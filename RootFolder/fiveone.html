  <h1 class="title">REGERTS</h1>
  <body>
    <p>She basically told you that she had this entire birthday party planned for you and that the least you could've done is show up. Now she and everyone else that went is upset at you. She also said that she doesn't want to talk to you, she didn't  say for how long. So make of that what you will. You didn't even know it was your birthday. plus you're pretty sure you spelled regrets wrong.</p>
