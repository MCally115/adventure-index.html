    <p>You get home after a long day of work, tired and hungry. The only thing that you want to do is eat and then go to sleep. But then it hits you that you're friend told you to come over to her apartment to help her move some furniture around 7:30pm. You look at the clock and see that its 5pm. You decide to take a quick shut-eye. You then wake up at 6pm. You look at your phone and see that there is no texts so you ponder for a bit and think whether you want to fall back asleep or get up and start getting ready.</p>
