    <p>But now you're running late, you try to catch the train that's already in the station but you miss it, now you have to wait 10 minutes for the next one. After the 10 minutes the next train finally arrives. You get on running a bit late but not too much you still have some time to get there. The train then comes to a stop because someone started to fight in the train in front of it. So now you and everyone else is going to have to wait until the police arrive and apprehend those individuals. You check your watch and notice that 20 minutes have passed and this train has yet to move. You play a little game on your phone, by the time you're done it has been a little over 30 minutes, and now you're definitly late. Finally the train starts again, you get off at your stop you rush to your friend's house, you don't even ring the bell because half the time it is broken, so you go through the basement. Rush up the stairs and knock, you then realize that you have a missed call and 9 text messages from your friend, you text her that you're here and to open up. You begin to hear a bunch of ruckus and then you hear "come in"</p>
